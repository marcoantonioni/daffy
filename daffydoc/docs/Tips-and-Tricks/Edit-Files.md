# Editing Files

## Basic vi commands you will use to edit your environment file:

Use the arrows on your keyboard to go to location you want to edit, you can not use your mouse.

++esc++    starts all modes and ++esc++  will end all modes.

Modes:

++esc++ - ++x++     = deletes one character where you cursor is. Once done ++esc++

++esc++ - ++i++      =  puts you in insert mode, just start typing what you want to add. Once done ++esc++

++esc++ - ++d++ - ++d++  = delete entire line cursor is on.  Once done ++esc++

++esc++ - ++u++     = will undo your last action.  Once done ++esc++

Once done, the following will save your file:

++esc++ - ++shift++ - ++colon++ - ++w++ - ++q++ ++enter++   

If you messed up the file and you want to exit and not save your file:

++esc++ - ++shift++ - ++colon++ - ++q++ - ++exclamation++ - ++enter++

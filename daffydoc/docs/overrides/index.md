!!! Warning
    There is less error checking on overrides that you add, so make sure you understand the override you are adding and its valid.

Daffy allows you to override many settings.  Most common installs do not need to do any overrides.

Overrides are simple, just add the override to your own Environment file with the value you want to override.
